    <h2>Building a Stronger Eastside — Together</h2>

    <p class="welcome-subtext">
      <em>Where Businesses & Neighborhoods Come Together — Serving Skyline Park, Willowwood Estates, Meadowview North, Meadowview Park, Salado Creek, and surrounding communities.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Willow Springs Alliance is a community-driven nonprofit uniting residents, businesses, 
      and local partners across the neighborhoods surrounding the Frost Bank Center corridor — 
      including Willowwood Estates, Meadowview North, Meadowview Park, Skyline Park, Salado Creek, 
      and our neighboring communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work hand-in-hand to create a vibrant, safe, and thriving Eastside where families, businesses, 
      and neighbors grow together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rooted in collaboration and pride, our alliance is powered by volunteers who believe in the strength 
      of community and the importance of having every voice heard. Together, we honor our past while shaping 
      a resilient, connected, and opportunity-rich future for everyone who calls Willow Springs home.
